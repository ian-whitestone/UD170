## Overview
The project was part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree which I am currently enrolled in (as of Nov 2016). The project is meant to serve as an introduction to exploratory data analysis, python, numpy and pandas. The project utilizes [Sean Lahman's](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) baseball dataset to determine what influence's a MLB batter's salary.

This report starts with a data wrangling phase involving data importing, merging and cleaning. Once prepped, the data is analyzed in the exploration phase and conclusions and suggestions for future studies are presented in the final section.

## Final Project
