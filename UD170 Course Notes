Python Sets Data Structure
- Sets are lists with no duplicate entries
- http://www.learnpython.org/en/Sets


To delete element:
- del list_or_dict['key_of_elemenet_to_be_deleted']



All conclusions you draw in this course will be tentative....you'd have to do a statistical test to determine whether relationship is true or jsut noise...

To differentiate between corellation and causation, need to conduct an A/B test.
